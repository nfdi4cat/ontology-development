# ontology-development for catalysis-related science

This repository contains the development of an ontology for catalysis-related science. The ontology is developed in the context of the NFDI4Cat project.
It is planned to develop the ontology in a modular way, with the possibility to extend it in the future.

## Ontology development

For the development of the ontology, the following steps are planned:

- collection of **Competency Questions** 

- collection of **Use cases**

- possible [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/)  queries 

... to tailor the NFDI4Cat vocabulary / ontology
