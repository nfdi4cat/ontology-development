# General remarks

To simplify writing the questions variables are used inside the questions. Variable always start with X as the first Variable and then continue with Y,Z,U,V,W as the respective placeholder.
Many of the questions allow for non-trivial permutations, for which reasons it might be best to also list these permutation blocks.
